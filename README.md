Laser Tagging with auto-calibration
=================================
(proof of concept)

Currently working when the room is very dark.
You need a red laser pointer, a video projector and a camera.

Usage: launch ./bb, move the output window to the
video projector, press any key to auto-calibrate, and
draw with the laser pointer.
